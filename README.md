# momentum-scroller
Enables OSX style momentum scrolling on Windows with Apple Trackpads

### IMPORTANT

You must set the "number of lines to scroll at a time" in the mouse control panel to 1 for this to work correctly.

This has been tested on a MacBook Pro only.   This will change the behaviour of any external mouse attached and may be useful with a magic mouse.
